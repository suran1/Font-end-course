                In this folder you will find two directories. There is an HTML and a JavaScript folder. Each folder has a set of directions
                in it. Follow the directions to the best of your ability. </p>
            <p>Don't wait to ask a question if you don't understand the directions.</p>
            <p>You have 4 hours to complete as much of this as you can. Please do not ask other students for help.
